# rewards_config.yaml - Balatro Poker RL Reward Configuration
# Dense Normalized Reward Structure for Better Learning
# All rewards normalized to roughly [-1, 1] scale with frequent feedback

# Terminal Outcomes - Normalized and balanced
outcome:
  win_bonus: 1.0              # Base reward for winning
  loss_penalty: 1.0            # Symmetric penalty for losing

# Efficiency Rewards
# Encourage winning quickly and conserving plays
efficiency:
  play_conservation_bonus: 0.25  # Bonus PER UNUSED play (max 1.0 for all 4 plays)
  step_penalty: 0.02             # Small per-action cost (~0.1 for typical episode)

# Incremental Progress Rewards
# Dense feedback based on chip accumulation
progress:
  chip_gain_scale: 1.0
  chip_normalization: 300        # Normalize to target score (300 chips = +1.0 reward)
                                  # Makes incremental progress much more important

  # Milestone bonuses when crossing percentage thresholds of target score
  target_threshold_bonuses:
    - threshold: 0.75           # Reaching 225/300 chips
      bonus: 0.25
    - threshold: 0.90           # Reaching 270/300 chips
      bonus: 0.5

# Hand Recognition Rewards
# Small bonuses for playing stronger poker hands (encourages learning hand evaluation)
# Keep these small so chip values remain primary signal

# Penalties
# Discourage undesirable behaviors
penalties:
  invalid_action: 0.5           # Penalty for attempting illegal moves
  desperate_play: 0.1           # Penalty for playing High Card when plays_left < 2 and far from target
  desperate_threshold: 0.5      # "Far from target" = less than this fraction of target score

# Advanced Shaping (Optional)
# These features can be enabled for more sophisticated reward engineering
advanced:
  # Reward winning with safety margin (beating target by large amount)
  safety_margin_bonus:
    enabled: false
    per_chip_over_target: 0.1   # Bonus per chip over target (e.g., 50 chips over = +5 reward)
    max_bonus: 100              # Cap the maximum safety margin bonus

  # Exploration bonuses (encourage trying diverse actions)
  exploration:
    enabled: false
    action_diversity_bonus: 5   # Bonus for using different action types in episode
